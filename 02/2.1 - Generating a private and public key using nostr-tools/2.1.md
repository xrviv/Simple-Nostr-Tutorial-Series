### Tutorial: Generating Private and Public Keys in a Node.js App using Nostr

#### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js Installed**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Basic Knowledge of Node.js and JavaScript**: Familiarity with Node.js and JavaScript basics will be helpful.

#### Step 1: Initialize a New Node.js Project

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

*bash*

```
mkdir nostr-app 
cd nostr-app 
npm init -y
```

This will create a new directory for your project (`nostr-app`) and initialize a new Node.js project inside it.

#### Step 2: Install `nostr-tools` Package

   Run the following command to install the `nostr-tools` package:

   *bash*

   `npm install nostr-tools`

   This package provides the necessary tools for interacting with the Nostr network.

#### Step 3: Create a JavaScript File

   Create a new file named `index.js` in your project directory. This file will contain your code.

#### Step 4: Write Code for Generating Keys

   Open `index.js` in your text editor and add the following code:

*javascript*

```
const { generateSecretKey, getPublicKey } = require('nostr-tools');  

// Generate a private key 
let sk = generateSecretKey();  // `sk` is a Uint8Array 
console.log("Private Key:", Buffer.from(sk).toString('hex'));  

// Derive the public key from the private key 
let pk = getPublicKey(sk);  // `pk` is a hex string 
console.log("Public Key:", pk);
```

This code imports the necessary functions from `nostr-tools`, generates a private key, and then derives the corresponding public key.

#### Step 5: Run Your Application

Back in your terminal, run your application with:

*bash*

`node index.js`

It should look like this:

```
Private Key: 850cbb86354d6f712a6c5b96cb83291aa80a8f6a369ffdbd67352b352861842d
Public Key: 3f9793cdb605d8f931173659bdf130af6bb98309d20ae0af7e81f84073ba62d8
```

You should see a private key and a public key printed on your terminal. These keys are essential for your identity on the Nostr network.

Notice something about the keypair? They're not in your standard npub, nsec formats. This will be the topic for the next lesson.

#### What's Next?

In this tutorial, you've learned how to start a Node.js project and generate cryptographic keys for use with Nostr. Next, we can explore more features such as creating and signing events, interacting with relays, or building a simple user interface.
