### 2.2: NIP-19

In the previous lesson. We generated a private and a public key pair. But did you notice something? 

```
Private Key: 850cbb86354d6f712a6c5b96cb83291aa80a8f6a369ffdbd67352b352861842d
Public Key: 3f9793cdb605d8f931173659bdf130af6bb98309d20ae0af7e81f84073ba62d8
```

It wasn't generated in the usual format of nostr keys, which are often prefaced with npub for public keys, and nsec for private keys. 

In the Nostr protocol, public keys are indeed often represented in a specific format, typically prefixed with a string like "npub" for clear identification and adherence to the protocol standards, particularly as defined in NIP-19. This format not only helps in differentiating public keys from other types of data but also serves as a self-descriptive identifier indicating the type of data (in this case, a Nostr public key).

However, the basic getPublicKey function from the nostr-tools library, as used in your script, generates the raw public key without any prefix or specific formatting. To adhere to the Nostr protocol standards and include the "npub" prefix, you would need to encode the public key using the NIP-19 standard.

Here we modify the script to follow these steps: 

    1. Generate a private key
    2. Encode the private key using NIP-19
    3. Derive the raw public key from the private key
    4. Encode the public key using NIP-19

Import the NIP-19 Encoding Function: First, you need to import the function for NIP-19 encoding from nostr-tools.

Encode the Private Key: After generating the raw private key, encode it using the NIP-19 standard, this will add the "nsec" prefix.

Encode the Public Key: After generating the raw public key, encode it using the NIP-19 standard, which will add the "npub" prefix.

Here is the modified version of our index.js:

```
const { generateSecretKey, getPublicKey, nip19 } = require('nostr-tools');

// Generate a private key
let sk = generateSecretKey();
console.log();
console.log("Raw Private Key:", Buffer.from(sk).toString('hex'))

// Encode the private key using NIP-19
let nsec = nip19.nsecEncode(sk);
console.log("NIP-19 Encoded Private Key (nsec):", nsec);
console.log();

// Derive the raw public key from the private key
let rawPublicKey = getPublicKey(sk);
console.log("Raw Public Key:", rawPublicKey);

// Encode the public key using NIP-19
let npub = nip19.npubEncode(rawPublicKey);
console.log("NIP-19 Encoded Public Key (npub):", npub);

```

In this script:

rawPublicKey is the unformatted public key.

npub is the NIP-19 encoded public key, which should start with the "npub" prefix.

By following this approach, your public key will be formatted according to the Nostr protocol's standards, making it compatible with other Nostr-compliant applications and services.

You should see something like this result:

```
Raw Private Key: 119428a824598464851daf38098112c578a4c1fe27c091409bfc333c4b6b9f1d

### Why?

NIP-19 (Nostr Implementation Proposal 19) plays a crucial role in the Nostr ecosystem, primarily focusing on standardized encoding for various types of data within the network. The main purposes of NIP-19 include:

1.  **Standardized Encoding**: It provides a standardized way of encoding different types of Nostr-related data, such as public keys, private keys, and profiles. This standardization is important for interoperability among different clients and services within the Nostr network.
2.  **Clear Identification**: The encoded data typically includes a prefix (like "npub" for public keys or "nsec" for private keys) that makes it easy to identify the type of data just by looking at the encoded string. This clarity is beneficial for both developers and users when handling different types of data.
3.  **Consistency and Compatibility**: By adhering to a common standard, NIP-19 ensures that various Nostr clients and tools can reliably interpret and use the data. This consistency is key in a decentralized environment where multiple independent implementations might exist.
4.  **Enhanced Security and Privacy**: For cryptographic elements like private keys, using a standardized encoding can also contribute to security and privacy. It helps in maintaining the correct format and ensuring that the keys are handled appropriately by different applications.
5.  **Human-Readable Format**: The encoding often results in a more human-readable format (like a Base58 or hexadecimal string), which is easier to display, share, and manage compared to raw binary formats.
6.  **Facilitating Data Exchange**: In a decentralized network like Nostr, where data exchange happens between various nodes and clients, having a common encoding format like that provided by NIP-19 simplifies the process of data transmission and reception.
