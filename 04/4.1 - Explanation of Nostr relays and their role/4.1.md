Nostr relays play a crucial role in the Nostr network, a protocol designed to create a censorship-resistant global "social" network. Here is an explanation of their role and function:

1.  **Functionality of Relays**: Relays in the Nostr network are quite straightforward and "dumb." They do not involve any trusted central server, making the system resilient. Instead, they are based on cryptographic keys and signatures, which ensures tamper-proof operations. Relays simply accept posts from users and forward them to others. This system doesn't rely on peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques, which contributes to its functionality​​.
2.  **User and Relay Interaction**: Every user in the Nostr network is identified by a public key, and every post they make is signed. Clients (the software run by users) validate these signatures. Users interact with the network through these clients, fetching data from relays of their choice and publishing data to other chosen relays. Importantly, relays do not communicate with each other but only directly with users. For instance, to "follow" someone, a user instructs their client to query the relays they know for posts from that public key​​.
3.  **Network Health and Data Storage**: The health of the Nostr network doesn't require a large number of active relays. A few relays can sustain the network effectively. However, the architecture is scalable; in the event of hundreds of niche relays run by amateurs, each could relay updates from a small group of users without needing to store data from other servers. This approach reduces the overall data storage requirements compared to similar software like Mastodon​​.
4.  **Censorship Resistance and Spam Management**: Users can publish their updates to any number of relays, enhancing censorship resistance. Relays might charge fees from users for publishing, which can vary as it is negotiated outside the protocol. This fee-based system not only supports the operational costs but also serves as a deterrent to spam. If spam becomes a concern, a relay can require payment for publication or some form of authentication, like an email address or phone number, and associate these with a public key that gets publishing rights on that relay. Relays used as spam vectors can be unlisted by clients, who can continue fetching updates from other relays​​.

Overall, Nostr relays are essential for maintaining the decentralized, resilient, and censorship-resistant nature of the network, providing a platform where users can freely publish and access information without relying on central authority or intermediaries.
