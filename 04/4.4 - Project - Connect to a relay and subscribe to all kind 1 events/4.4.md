In this code, we:

1. Connect to the specified relay wss://nostr.wine.
2. Subscribe to events of kind 1 (text notes) 

```
global.WebSocket = require('ws'); // Be sure to install `npm install ws`
const { Relay } = require('nostr-tools'); // Be sure to install `npm install nostr-tools`

async function subscribeToAllTextNotes() {
  const relayUrl = 'wss://nostr.wine'; // Replace with your relay URL
  try {
    const relay = await Relay.connect(relayUrl);
    console.log(`Connected to relay ${relay.url}`);

    // Subscribe to all events of kind 1 (text notes)
    const sub = relay.subscribe([
      {
        kinds: [1],
      },
    ], {
      onevent(event) {
        console.log('Text note event received:', event);
      },
      oneose() {
        sub.close();
      }
    });

    console.log("Waiting for text note events...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      sub.close();
      console.log('Subscription closed.');
    }, 60000); // Keep subscription open for 60 seconds
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error connecting to relay:', error);
  }
}

subscribeToAllTextNotes();
```

The provided Node.js script is designed to connect to a Nostr relay, subscribe to a specific type of event (in this case, text notes), and print the details of these events to the console as they are received. The script is structured to work in a Node.js environment, which differs from a browser environment in terms of WebSocket support. Let's break down the script for a clearer understanding:

1.  **WebSocket Library Import and Global Assignment**:

    ```
    global.WebSocket = require('ws');
    ```

-   In a Node.js environment, the native `WebSocket` object available in browsers is not present. Therefore, we use the `ws` library, a popular WebSocket implementation for Node.js.
-   `global.WebSocket = require('ws')`: This line imports the `ws` library and assigns it to the global `WebSocket` variable. By doing this, any subsequent code (or libraries) that expect a `WebSocket` object can use this implementation.
2.  **Importing Nostr Tools**:

    ```
    const { Relay } = require('nostr-tools');
    ```

-   This line imports the `Relay` class from the `nostr-tools` package, which provides functionality to interact with Nostr relays.

3.  **Function Definition - `subscribeToAllTextNotes`**:

    ```
    async function subscribeToAllTextNotes() {
      const relayUrl = 'wss://nostr.wine'; // Replace with your relay URL
      try {
        const relay = await Relay.connect(relayUrl);
        console.log(`Connected to relay ${relay.url}`);

        // Subscribe to all events of kind 1 (text notes)
        const sub = relay.subscribe([
          {
            kinds: [1],
          },
        ], {
          onevent(event) {
            console.log('Text note event received:', event);
          },
          oneose() {
            sub.close();
          }
        });
    ```
-   The function `subscribeToAllTextNotes` encapsulates the logic for connecting to a Nostr relay, setting up a subscription, and handling received events.

4.  **Connecting to a Relay**:

    ```
    const relay = await Relay.connect(relayUrl);
    ```

-   Here, the script attempts to establish a connection to a Nostr relay specified by `relayUrl`. This URL should be replaced with the actual URL of the Nostr relay you intend to use.
-   `Relay.connect(relayUrl)`: This asynchronous call creates a connection to the specified relay.

5.  **Setting Up a Subscription**:

    ```
    const sub = relay.subscribe([...], {...});
    ```

-   Once connected to the relay, the script subscribes to specific events. In this case, it's set up to subscribe to all events of kind 1 (text notes).
-   The `subscribe` method takes two main parameters: an array of filters defining the types of events to subscribe to and a callback object to handle events and subscription closure.

6.  **Handling Events and Subscription Closure**:
-   `onevent(event) {...}`: This function is called whenever an event that matches the subscription filter is received. It logs the details of the event to the console.
-   `oneose() {...}`: This function is called when the subscription is closed. It is used here to clean up resources.

7.  **Timeout for Subscription**:

    ```
    setTimeout(() => {...}, 60000);
    ```

-   This part of the code sets a timeout (60 seconds in this example) after which the subscription will be automatically closed. This is important to prevent the script from running indefinitely.

8.  **Running the Function**:
-   Finally, `subscribeToAllTextNotes()` is called to execute the subscription logic.

The output shows the following:

Now, what if we modify this to show kind 2 (follows) events?

As you may recall, kind 2 events are follows.

This script is a basic demonstration of how to interact with Nostr relays using `nostr-tools` in Node.js. It showcases connecting to a relay, subscribing to specific events, and handling real-time data. Remember to replace the placeholder relay URL with a valid Nostr relay endpoint for actual use.
