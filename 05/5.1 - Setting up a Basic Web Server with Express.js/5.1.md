### Previously

1. We've generated our private key
2. Derived its NIP-19 equivalent
3. We derived the public key from this private key
4. We encoded the public key according to NIP-19 specifications
5. We defined our event template
6. We signed the event with our private key

**In this lesson 5.1 we will**

7. Building a Basic User Interface with Express.js for NOSTR
    - Step 1: Install Express.js and Dependencies
    - Step 2: Set Up the Express Server
    - Step 3: Add NOSTR Functionality to the Server
    - Step 4: Test the Server

### Pre-requisites for the exercise

- $ npm install express websocket-polyfill nostr-tools body-parser
- If on a Windows 11 machine, use [Postman](https://postman.com) later to test 
- If on a Linux machine, use `curl` to test later

#### Wait! I thought Nostr was decentralized and does not need a server-client model? Why are we using Express.js?

In the context of our tutorial, setting up an Express.js server isn't for the purpose of creating a central server for NOSTR. Instead, it's for educational and demonstration purposes, to illustrate how one can interact with the NOSTR network through a web interface. Here are a few reasons why you might still want to set up an Express.js server in this scenario:

1.  **Demonstration and Education**: If you're creating a tutorial or teaching material, an Express.js server can be a useful tool to demonstrate how to interact with NOSTR from a web application. It helps in illustrating the concepts and client-side operations in a more interactive and user-friendly manner.
2.  **Serving Web Content**: The Express.js server can be used to serve the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that make up the user interface of the web application. This allows users to interact with the NOSTR network through a web browser.
3.  **Intermediate Processing**: Although NOSTR operates in a decentralized manner, there might be use cases where you want to perform some processing, logging, or handling of data before it is sent to or received from NOSTR relays. An Express.js server can act as an intermediary for such purposes.
4.  **Learning and Experimentation**: For learners and developers new to NOSTR, setting up a simple web server provides a controlled environment to experiment with the protocol, understand its workings, and explore various functionalities.

It's important to clarify that this server does not alter the decentralized nature of NOSTR itself. It merely acts as an interface for users to interact with the NOSTR network, especially in scenarios where a standalone client application isn't feasible or desired. The core NOSTR interactions still happen with decentralized relays, and the Express.js server does not centralize or control the NOSTR network.

#### Getting Started with Express

Go to the `05\5.1 - Setting up a Basic Web Server with Express.js\nostr-express-project folder` via your terminal application. There you will find app.js:

```
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the NOSTR Express Tutorial!');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

```

**Execute:** `npm-init-y`

**Execute:** `npm install express body-parser`

The `app.js` code mixed with our latest code from lesson 4.6' code should look like this:

```
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const { generateSecretKey, getPublicKey, nip19, finalizeEvent, Relay } = require('nostr-tools');
const WebSocket = require('websocket-polyfill');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the NOSTR Express Tutorial!');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

// Generate a private key 
let sk = generateSecretKey();
console.log("Raw Private Key:", Buffer.from(sk).toString('hex'))

// Encode the private key using NIP-19 nsecEncode method
let nsec = nip19.nsecEncode(sk);
console.log("NIP-19 Encoded Private Key (nsec):", nsec);

// Derive the public key 
let pk = getPublicKey(sk);
console.log("Raw Public Key:", pk);

// Encode the public key using NIP-19 npubEncode method
let npub = nip19.npubEncode(pk);
console.log("NIP-19 Encoded Public Key (npub):", npub);

// Define an event template
let eventTemplate = {
  kind: 1,
  created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  tags: [],
  content: 'Hello World! This is a kind 1 note from the Simple Nostr Tutorial Series',
};

// Sign the event with the private key
let signedEvent = finalizeEvent(eventTemplate, sk);
console.log("Signed Event:", signedEvent);

// Connect to the relay and publish the event
(async () => {
  try {
    const relay = await Relay.connect('wss://nos.lol', { WebSocket });
    await relay.publish(signedEvent);
    console.log('Event published successfully.');
    relay.close();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error publishing event:', error);
  }
})();
```

### However, chatGPT wants to modify some things.

1.  **Dynamic Event Creation**: Instead of using a hardcoded message in the `eventTemplate`, you might want to allow users to input their own messages through the web interface. This means the content of the event should be dynamically set based on user input.

2.  **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide meaningful feedback to the user interface in case of failures, such as issues in connecting to the relay or in the event creation process.
3.  **Endpoint Creation**: Create a specific endpoint (e.g., `/publish`) in your Express.js server that handles the publishing of events. This endpoint will receive requests from your web interface and use the NOSTR tools to create and publish events.
4.  **Response Handling**: After publishing an event, the server should send an appropriate response back to the client. This could be a success message, the details of the published event, or error information.

Our code then, incorporates these changes: 

```
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const { generateSecretKey, getPublicKey, nip19, finalizeEvent, Relay } = require('nostr-tools');
const WebSocket = require('websocket-polyfill');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/publish', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const content = req.body.content || 'Default NOSTR message';

    let sk = generateSecretKey();
    let pk = getPublicKey(sk);
    let eventTemplate = {
      kind: 1,
      created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      tags: [],
      content: content,
    };
    let signedEvent = finalizeEvent(eventTemplate, sk);

    const relay = await Relay.connect('wss://nos.lol', { WebSocket });
    await relay.publish(signedEvent);
    relay.close();

    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Event published successfully', event: signedEvent });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error publishing event:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error publishing event', error: error.toString() });
  }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

-   `express`: This imports the Express.js library, which is used to create the web server.
-   `bodyParser`: Middleware that parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property. Here, it's used to parse JSON bodies.
-   `app`: This creates an instance of an Express application.
-   `app.use(bodyParser.json())`: This tells the Express app to use the `bodyParser` middleware to automatically parse JSON payloads.

#### Create a publish endpoint
```
app.post('/publish', async (req, res) => {
  // ... Event publishing logic ...
});
```
-   This code snippet sets up a POST endpoint at `/publish`. When a POST request is made to this endpoint, the included function is executed.
-   `async`: Indicates that the function is asynchronous, allowing the use of `await` for asynchronous operations.

#### Publishing a Nostr Event

- Within the /publish endpoint

```
try {
    const content = req.body.content || 'Default NOSTR message';
    // ... Key generation and event creation logic ...
    const relay = await Relay.connect('wss://nos.lol', { WebSocket });
    await relay.publish(signedEvent);
    relay.close();

    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Event published successfully', event: signedEvent });
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error publishing event:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error publishing event', error: error.toString() });
}
```

-   This block tries to publish an event to the NOSTR network. If there's an error during this process, it catches the error and sends an error response.
-   `req.body.content`: Fetches the content from the request body. If no content is provided, a default message is used.
-   `generateSecretKey`, `getPublicKey`, `finalizeEvent`: These functions from `nostr-tools` are used to generate a private key, derive the public key, create an event template, and sign the event.
-   `Relay.connect`: Connects to a NOSTR relay (in this case, 'wss://nos.lol') using a WebSocket connection.
-   `relay.publish`: Publishes the signed event to the NOSTR network.
-   `relay.close()`: Closes the relay connection after publishing.
-   `res.status(200).json(...)`: Sends a JSON response back to the client indicating success.
-   In the `catch` block, it logs the error and returns an error response to the client.

#### Starting the Server

```
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```
-   This code starts the Express server on a specified port (`3000` by default, or a port specified by the environment).
-   `app.listen`: This method is used to bind and listen for connections on the specified host and port.

#### Overall Workflow

-   When a POST request is sent to `/publish` (e.g., from a web form on the frontend), the server takes the message content from the request, generates a new NOSTR event, and publishes it to the specified relay.
-   The response from the server will indicate whether the event was published successfully or if there was an error.

#### Disambiguation of "Publishing Endpoints"

In plain English, "create a publish endpoint" means setting up a specific location or address within your web application where certain actions can be performed. In this context, it's like creating a special mailbox on your website where visitors can submit their messages (events) to be published.

Here's a breakdown of the analogy:

-   **Web Application as Your House**: Think of your web application as a house.
-   **Endpoint as a Mailbox**: An endpoint in a web application is similar to a mailbox in a house. Just as a mailbox is a specific location where people can drop off letters, an endpoint is a specific location (in the form of a URL) where users can send data or requests.
-   **Publish Action as Sending a Letter**: The action of publishing an event in NOSTR is like writing a letter. When someone wants to publish something, they write their message (create an event) and need a place to send it.
-   **'/publish' Endpoint as a Specialized Mailbox**: By creating a '/publish' endpoint, it's like you're setting up a specialized mailbox for a specific type of mail – in this case, for sending messages to be published on the NOSTR network. Just like how you might have a mailbox for regular mail and another for parcels, your web application has different endpoints for different actions.
-   **Sending Data to the Endpoint**: When users of your application want to publish a message, they send their data (the event) to this special '/publish' endpoint, similar to how someone would put a letter in a mailbox.

So, in summary, when we say "create a publish endpoint," we're talking about setting up a designated area in your web application where users can send their messages (or events) to be published on the NOSTR network. This endpoint listens for incoming data (like a mailbox waiting for letters) and processes it accordingly (like sending the letters to their intended recipients).

#### Testing the Server

We run the server by executing `node app.js`

We get: 

```
Server running on port 3000
```

We then download [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (since I am currently on my Windows machine)

#### Instructions on how to use:

### Using Postman

1.  **Open Postman**: If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the Postman website.
2.  **Create a New Request**:
    -   Click on the `New` button or the `+` tab to open a new request tab.
    -   Set the HTTP method to `POST`.
    -   Enter the URL for your endpoint, which will be something like `http://localhost:3000/publish` (assuming your server is running on port 3000 on your local machine).
3.  **Add JSON Body**:
    -   Go to the `Body` tab below the URL field.
    -   Select `raw` and choose `JSON` from the dropdown that appears to the right.
    -   In the text area provided, enter your JSON data. For example:

        jsonCopy code

        `{   "content": "Your message here" }`

4.  **Send the Request**:
    -   Click the `Send` button.
    -   Postman will display the response from your server in the lower section of the window.

It should look like this:

### Other notes

#### Using `curl` instead of Postman

Curl behaves differently in Windows Powershell, as opposed to a Linux system. If you are an on an Ubuntu Machine, you can use curl with the following instructions: 

### Using cURL

Alternatively, you can use `cURL` in a terminal or command prompt. This is a command-line tool available on most operating systems.

1.  **Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt**.
2.  **Type the cURL Command**:
    -   The command will look something like this:

        bashCopy code

        `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/publish -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content": "Your message here"}'`

    -   `-X POST` specifies that it's a POST request.
    -   `http://localhost:3000/publish` is the URL of your endpoint.
    -   `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` sets the content type header to `application/json`.
    -   `-d '{"content": "Your message here"}'` is the data being sent in the request.

## Summary

### Building a Basic User Interface with Express.js for NOSTR

#### **Step 1: Install Express.js and Dependencies**

You set up a new Node.js project and installed Express.js along with necessary dependencies like `body-parser` and `nostr-tools`. This laid the foundation for building a web server capable of handling HTTP requests and interacting with the NOSTR network.

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Express Server**

You created an Express.js server by initializing an Express application and configuring it to use `body-parser` middleware for parsing JSON request bodies. This server acts as the backend for your web application, handling requests and sending responses.

#### **Step 3: Add NOSTR Functionality to the Server**

In this crucial step, you integrated NOSTR functionalities into the Express server. You achieved this by:

-   Generating a NOSTR private key and deriving the corresponding public key.
-   Creating an event template with the ability to include dynamic content from user input.
-   Signing the event using the private key.
-   Connecting to a NOSTR relay and publishing the event.

This was implemented in a `/publish` endpoint on your Express server, which handles POST requests to publish events to the NOSTR network.

#### **Step 4: Test the Server**

You successfully tested the `/publish` endpoint using Postman and/or cURL. This involved sending a POST request with a JSON payload to your server, which then processed the request and published an event to the NOSTR network. The successful response indicated that your server is correctly handling requests and interacting with the NOSTR network.

### Accomplishments

-   **Built a Backend Server**: You now have a functioning backend server that can receive HTTP requests, process them, and interact with the NOSTR network.
-   **Integrated NOSTR Functionality**: Your server is equipped to handle NOSTR-related operations, such as generating keys, creating and signing events, and communicating with NOSTR relays.
-   **Successfully Tested Endpoint**: By testing the `/publish` endpoint, you confirmed that your server is capable of publishing events to the NOSTR network and responding appropriately to client requests.

With these steps completed, you've laid the groundwork for a web application that interfaces with the NOSTR network, capable of publishing events and potentially more complex interactions in the future. The next steps (Step 5 and Step 6) would involve building and integrating the frontend, allowing user interaction through a web interface.
