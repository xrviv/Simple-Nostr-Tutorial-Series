## Create a Basic Front End for the Express.js Nostr Server

### Previously

1. We've generated our private key (Lesson 2.1)
2. Derived its NIP-19 equivalent (Lesson 2.2)
3. We derived the public key from this private key (Lesson 2.1)
4. We encoded the public key according to NIP-19 specifications (Lesson 2.2)
5. We defined our event template (Lesson 3.2)
6. We signed the event with our private key (Lesson 3.2)
7. We published an event to a relay and learned about NoteIDs (Lesson 4.6)
8. Built a Basic User Interface with Express.js for NOSTR (Lesson 5.1)
    - Step 1: Install Express.js and Dependencies
    - Step 2: Set Up the Express Server
    - Step 3: Add NOSTR Functionality to the Server
    - Step 4: Test the Server

**In lesson 5.2 we will**

9. Create a basic html front for the express.js nostr server

### Lesson 5.2 

First, we need to create a folder named 'public' in the root directory of the project. Then we create a basic html page with a form:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>NOSTR Express Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>NOSTR Event Publisher</h1>
  <form action="http://localhost:3000/publish" method="post">
    <textarea name="content" placeholder="Enter your message here"></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Publish Event</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Then we will modify the app.js file (Which we made in lesson 5.1) inside the `nostr-express-project` sub-folder, (I've already made the changes): 

```
// ... [previous code]

const path = require('path');

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/index.html'));
});

// ... [rest of the code]
```
Let's break down these new elements:

### `path` Module

`const path = require('path');`

-   The `path` module is a core Node.js module that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It's used here to ensure that file paths are correctly and consistently constructed across different operating systems.

### Static File Serving

`app.use(express.static('public'));`

-   `express.static('public')` is a middleware in Express.js used to serve static files. In this case, it's set up to serve files from a folder named `public` in your project directory. This is where you would typically put static assets like HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files.

### Parse incoming request bodies in a URL-encoded format

`app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`

-   **Purpose**: This line sets up middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a URL-encoded format. The `urlencoded` parser handles the data sent by HTML forms.
-   **Functionality**: When a form is submitted, the data sent to the server is in a format known as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This middleware parses that data and makes it available in `req.body`.
-   **Options**:
    -   `extended: true` vs `extended: false`: The `extended` option allows for rich data (like arrays and objects) to be encoded into the URL-encoded format, using a library called qs. If it's false, it uses the querystring library. Setting it to `true` is recommended for more feature-rich applications.
-   **Use Case**: This is crucial for applications that need to process data sent from traditional web forms. Without this middleware, `req.body` would be `undefined` when you try to access form data.

### Serving the `index.html` File

`app.get('/', (req, res) => {   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/index.html')); });`

-   This code creates a route that listens for GET requests to the root URL (`'/'`) of your server.
-   `res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/index.html'))`: When this route is accessed, it responds by sending the `index.html` file to the client. The `__dirname` is a Node.js global variable that contains the absolute path of the directory containing the current module, and `path.join()` is used to construct the path to `index.html` in a platform-independent way.

### Listening on a Port

``const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; app.listen(PORT, () => {   console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`); });``

-   This sets the port on which your Express.js server will listen. It first checks if there's a port specified in the environment variables (`process.env.PORT`), which is a common practice for deploying to various hosting environments that assign ports dynamically. If no environment-specific port is found, it defaults to port 3000.
-   `app.listen(...)`: This starts the server and makes it listen for incoming requests on the specified `PORT`. The callback function is executed once the server is up and running, logging a message to the console.

With these elements, your server is set up to handle both static file serving (your frontend interface) and dynamic POST requests to interact with the NOSTR network, providing a full-stack solution for your application.
