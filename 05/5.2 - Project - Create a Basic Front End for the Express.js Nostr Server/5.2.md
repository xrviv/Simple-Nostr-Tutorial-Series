## Create a Basic Front End for the Express.js Nostr Server

### Previously

1. We've generated our private key (Lesson 2.1)
2. Derived its NIP-19 equivalent (Lesson 2.2)
3. We derived the public key from this private key (Lesson 2.1)
4. We encoded the public key according to NIP-19 specifications (Lesson 2.2)
5. We defined our event template (Lesson 3.2)
6. We signed the event with our private key (Lesson 3.2)
7. We published an event to a relay and learned about NoteIDs (Lesson 4.6)
8. Built a Basic User Interface with Express.js for NOSTR (Lesson 5.1)
    - Step 1: Install Express.js and Dependencies
    - Step 2: Set Up the Express Server
    - Step 3: Add NOSTR Functionality to the Server
    - Step 4: Test the Server

**In lesson 5.2 we will**

9. Create a basic html front for the express.js nostr server

### Lesson 5.2 

First, we need to create a folder named 'public' in the root directory of the project. Then we create a basic html page with a form:

*Open `index.html`*

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>NOSTR Express Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>NOSTR Event Publisher</h1>
  <form action="http://localhost:3000/publish" method="post">
    <textarea name="content" placeholder="Enter your message here"></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Publish Event</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Then we will modify the app.js file (Which we made in lesson 5.1) inside the `nostr-express-project` sub-folder, (I've already made the changes): 

```
// ... [previous code]

const path = require('path');

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); 

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/public/index.html'));
});

// ... [rest of the code]
```
Let's break down these new elements:

### `path` Module

`const path = require('path');`

-   The `path` module is a core Node.js module that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It's used here to ensure that file paths are correctly and consistently constructed across different operating systems.

### Static File Serving

`app.use(express.static('public'));`

-   `express.static('public')` is a middleware in Express.js used to serve static files. In this case, it's set up to serve files from a folder named `public` in your project directory. This is where you would typically put static assets like HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files.

### Parse incoming request bodies in a URL-encoded format

`app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`

-   **Purpose**: This line sets up middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a URL-encoded format. The `urlencoded` parser handles the data sent by HTML forms.
-   **Functionality**: When a form is submitted, the data sent to the server is in a format known as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This middleware parses that data and makes it available in `req.body`.
-   **Options**:
    -   `extended: true` vs `extended: false`: The `extended` option allows for rich data (like arrays and objects) to be encoded into the URL-encoded format, using a library called qs. If it's false, it uses the querystring library. Setting it to `true` is recommended for more feature-rich applications.
-   **Use Case**: This is crucial for applications that need to process data sent from traditional web forms. Without this middleware, `req.body` would be `undefined` when you try to access form data.

### Serving the `index.html` File

`app.get('/', (req, res) => {   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/public/index.html')); });`

-   This code creates a route that listens for GET requests to the root URL (`'/'`) of your server.
-   `res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/public/index.html'))`: When this route is accessed, it responds by sending the `index.html` file to the client. The `__dirname` is a Node.js global variable that contains the absolute path of the directory containing the current module, and `path.join()` is used to construct the path to `index.html` in a platform-independent way.

### Listening on a Port

``const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; app.listen(PORT, () => {   console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`); });``

-   This sets the port on which your Express.js server will listen. It first checks if there's a port specified in the environment variables (`process.env.PORT`), which is a common practice for deploying to various hosting environments that assign ports dynamically. If no environment-specific port is found, it defaults to port 3000.
-   `app.listen(...)`: This starts the server and makes it listen for incoming requests on the specified `PORT`. The callback function is executed once the server is up and running, logging a message to the console.

With these elements, your server is set up to handle both static file serving (your frontend interface) and dynamic POST requests to interact with the NOSTR network, providing a full-stack solution for your application.

The webpage should look like this:

After clicking publish, it should look like this:

**Notice** that this method displays the JSON file in the main webpage, which is an unintended behavior. 

The "Publish Event" button on our form is causing the JSON response from the server to be displayed directly in the main webpage, it suggests that the form is being submitted in the default manner, which navigates to the response URL (in this case, your `/publish` endpoint). To handle the form submission without navigating away from the page, you'll need to use JavaScript to capture the form submission event and then use AJAX to send the data to the server.

#### ChatGPT4 offers us 6 potential solutions

### 1\. Full Page Refresh with Server-side Rendering

-   **How It Works**: After the form is submitted, the server handles the request and then redirects the user back to a fresh form or to a new page.
-   **Implementation**: In your Express.js route, after processing the form submission, use `res.redirect('/')` to redirect back to the form page.
-   **Pros**: Simple to implement, no need for client-side JavaScript for form handling.
-   **Cons**: Not as seamless for the user since it involves a full page reload.

### 2\. AJAX Submission with Client-side Update (as previously described)

-   **How It Works**: Use JavaScript to handle the form submission asynchronously using AJAX, then update the page based on the server response without reloading the page.
-   **Pros**: Provides a smooth user experience without page reloads; great for dynamic, interactive sites.
-   **Cons**: Requires more complex JavaScript and isn't suitable for websites that aim to work without JavaScript.

### 3\. iFrame Submission

-   **How It Works**: The form targets an invisible `iframe`. When submitted, the form's output loads in the `iframe`, keeping the main page unchanged.
-   **Pros**: No full page reload, simpler than AJAX as it doesn't require extensive JavaScript.
-   **Cons**: Can be clunky, less modern, and may have complications with cross-domain policies.

### 4\. JavaScript Form Submission with Full Page Reload

-   **How It Works**: Similar to the AJAX approach but after the submission, the page is reloaded using JavaScript.
-   **Pros**: Still provides control over the submission process; can show loading states or messages before the reload.
-   **Cons**: Involves a page reload, so not as seamless as pure AJAX.

### 5\. Using JavaScript Libraries or Frameworks

-   **How It Works**: Utilize libraries like jQuery or frameworks like React or Vue.js to handle form submissions more elegantly.
-   **Pros**: Can provide a very smooth user experience; great for SPA (Single Page Applications).
-   **Cons**: Requires knowledge of these libraries/frameworks and more complex setup.

### 6\. Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets

-   **How It Works**: Establish a persistent connection with the server using SSE or WebSockets to handle real-time updates after form submission.
-   **Pros**: Allows for real-time, two-way communication between client and server.
-   **Cons**: More complex to set up and manage; overkill for simple form submissions.

## Multiple Issues with the first index.html file

In our first file, `index.html`, instead of displaying a notification that says whether the event was successfully published or not, we get the entire JSON file as explained above. The fix we opted for was the AJAX Submission with Client-side Update. 

### AJAX

    AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a technique used in web development to make asynchronous requests to a server without needing to refresh the entire web page. With AJAX, a web page can request data, retrieve it, and update its content dynamically, leading to a smoother, more interactive user experience. It relies on JavaScript and the `XMLHttpRequest` object (or more modernly, the `fetch` API) to communicate with web servers and handle data, often in JSON format, allowing parts of a web page to be updated with new information without a full reload.

### Open **index2.html**

Additional steps: `$ npm install cors`

This step is needed since when we tested the app.js server and the html page, we kept receiving an error. 

- App.js ran in port 3000 
- index.html ran in port 5500 since we were using Visual Studio Code's Go live function. 

### Add this to app.js

```
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```
### HTML Structure

-   The page includes a form (`<form id="publishForm">`) where users can enter a message in a textarea and submit it with a button.
-   There's a `<div id="responseMessage"></div>` to display responses from the server.

### JavaScript Functionality

-   `document.getElementById('publishForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {...})`: This JavaScript adds an event listener to the form. It listens for the `submit` event, and when the form is submitted, it runs the function defined inside.
-   `event.preventDefault();`: This prevents the default form submission behavior, which would reload the page.
-   `var formData = new FormData(this);`: Creates a `FormData` object from the form, which is a way to easily access the data entered in the form fields.
-   `var formBody = Array.from(formData.entries())...`: Converts the `FormData` object into a URL-encoded string, which is the format required for sending the data in a POST request with the `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'` content type.

### AJAX Request with `fetch`

-   `fetch('http://localhost:3000/publish', {...})`: This sends an asynchronous HTTP POST request to the server at the specified URL. It uses the `fetch` API, a modern way to make network requests in JavaScript.
-   `method: 'POST'`: Specifies that this is a POST request.
-   `headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' }`: Sets the content type of the request to URL-encoded form data.
-   `body: formBody`: The body of the request contains the form data in URL-encoded format.

### Handling the Server Response

-   `.then(response => response.json())`: Converts the response from the server to JSON format.
-   `.then(data => {...})`: Handles the JSON response. It updates the text inside the `responseMessage` div with the message received from the server.
-   `.catch(error => {...})`: Catches any errors that occur during the fetch request. If an error occurs, it sets the text inside the `responseMessage` div to indicate failure.

This setup allows the web page to submit form data to the server without reloading the page and to display the server's response dynamically. This enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback and a more interactive feel.

## Where's the JSON? 

Upon successful execution of `index2.html`, we come across a new problem, the JSON is no longer being displayed - not even in the console. To display the JSON data in the console, uncomment line 31. 

```
console.log('Response from server:', data);
```
