## Display Events in a Web Page

### Previously

1. We've generated our private key (Lesson 2.1)
2. Derived its NIP-19 equivalent (Lesson 2.2)
3. We derived the public key from this private key (Lesson 2.1)
4. We encoded the public key according to NIP-19 specifications (Lesson 2.2)
5. We defined our event template (Lesson 3.2)
6. We signed the event with our private key (Lesson 3.2)
7. We published an event to a relay and learned about NoteIDs (Lesson 4.6)
8. Built a Basic User Interface with Express.js for NOSTR (Lesson 5.1)
    - Step 1: Install Express.js and Dependencies
    - Step 2: Set Up the Express Server
    - Step 3: Add NOSTR Functionality to the Server
    - Step 4: Test the Server
9. Create a basic HTML frontend for the express.js nostr server (Lesson 5.2)
    - Remove the JSON response after clicking `Publish Event`
    - Log the JSON response in the console instead

**In Lesson 5.3 - Displaying Events in the Front End**

10. Subscribe to events in a relay, and display these in a webpage.
    - Filter to show only the content
    - Style the content and include the timestamp

#### Prerequisites

- Go to the directory `nostr-app`
- Run `npm install express ws nostr-tools` 
- Run `node server.js` first. 
- Open http://localhost:3000, which should open `index.html` in a browser.

`server.js` and `index.html` forms a basic web application that connects to a Nostr relay, subscribes to all text note events (kind 1), and then forwards these events to any connected WebSocket clients. The setup is straightforward and aligns well with typical patterns for building real-time web applications using Node.js, Express, and WebSocket.

Here's a brief breakdown of how the code works:

### server.js

1.  **Setup Express and HTTP Server:** You're using Express to serve your web content (`index.html`) and creating an HTTP server which integrates with the WebSocket server.
2.  **WebSocket Server:** You initialize a WebSocket server that listens for client connections. When a client connects or disconnects, it logs these events to the console.
3.  **Nostr Relay Subscription:** The function `subscribeToAllTextNotes` connects to a Nostr relay at `wss://relay.damus.io`. It subscribes to all events of kind 1 (text notes) and, upon receiving an event, broadcasts this event to all connected WebSocket clients.
4.  **Listening on Port 3000:** Your HTTP server listens on port 3000 and serves your `index.html` page.

### index.html

1.  **WebSocket Client Setup:** When the page loads, it sets up a WebSocket connection to your server at `ws://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Handling Incoming Messages:** When a message is received from the WebSocket server, it's parsed from JSON, and its content is added to an unordered list in the HTML.

The page generated should look like this:

The data looks quite unkempt as it outputs the entire JSON, including other fields. 

*Code for displaying events including other fields*

```
<script>
    var socket;

    function setupWebSocket() {
        socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000');
        socket.onmessage = function(event) {
            var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
            var node = document.createElement("LI");
            var textnode = document.createTextNode(JSON.stringify(data));
            node.appendChild(textnode);
            document.getElementById("eventsList").appendChild(node);
        };
    }

    window.onload = setupWebSocket;
</script>
```

We will replace it with this code, which should only show the `content` field.

```
<script>
    var socket;

    function setupWebSocket() {
        socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000');
        socket.onmessage = function(event) {
            var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
            
            // Check if the data contains a content field
            if (data.content) {
                var node = document.createElement("LI");
                var textnode = document.createTextNode(data.content);
                node.appendChild(textnode);
                document.getElementById("eventsList").appendChild(node);
            }
        };
    }

    window.onload = setupWebSocket;
</script>
```

### Notes

1. In our previous implementation, we used: 

```
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});
```

This specified that only index.html received the data. So when I created a new page with content only output, it encountered an error. I commented out the `app.get` line and instead opted for: 

```
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```

- Then added `const path = require('path');`
- Created the folder `public`, where both `index.html` and `content.html` reside. 
- I then linked to `content.html` where only the content is shown in the page.
- I then linked to a slightly styled `styled.html` where the content and time-stamp is showed in the middle column

#### Content Only `content.html`

#### Styled content `styled.html`

### Code Explanation for styled.html

```
 var socket;
    
        function setupWebSocket() {
            socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000');
            socket.onmessage = function(event) {
                var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
```

1.  `var socket;`: This line declares a variable named `socket`. This variable is intended to hold the WebSocket object, which represents the WebSocket connection. By declaring it outside of any function, it is made available globally in the script, meaning it can be accessed from any function within the script.

2.  `function setupWebSocket() { ... }`: This defines a function named `setupWebSocket`. This function, when called, will create a new WebSocket connection.

3.  `socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000');`: Inside the `setupWebSocket` function, this line creates a new instance of the WebSocket object, connecting to the WebSocket server at the specified URL (`ws://localhost:3000`). The `ws` scheme specifies that an unencrypted WebSocket connection is being established. `localhost:3000` indicates that the server is running on the local machine (`localhost`) and is listening on port 3000.

4.  `socket.onmessage = function(event) { ... }`: This line sets up an event handler for the 'message' event on the WebSocket object (`socket`). The function defined here will be called whenever a message is received from the server. The `event` parameter represents the event object that contains information about the received message.

5.  `var data = JSON.parse(event.data);`: Inside the `onmessage` event handler, this line parses the data received from the server. `event.data` contains the raw data sent by the server. Since this data is typically sent as a JSON string, `JSON.parse()` is used to convert this string into a JavaScript object for easier handling in the client-side script.

In summary, this code sets up a WebSocket client that connects to a WebSocket server running on `localhost` at port `3000`. When the client receives a message from the server, it parses the JSON string into a JavaScript object. The `setupWebSocket` function encapsulates the logic for initializing the WebSocket connection and handling incoming messages.

```
if (data.content) {
    var node = document.createElement("LI");
    node.classList.add('event-item');

    var contentNode = document.createTextNode(data.content);
    var contentSpan = document.createElement("SPAN");
    contentSpan.appendChild(contentNode);
```

This code checks if there is content data available, and if so, creates a list item (`<li>`) with a `span` element inside it, containing the text from `data.content`. This structure is prepared for insertion into the webpage's DOM, likely to be part of an ordered or unordered list, where each item represents some piece of content received from a server.

1.  `if (data.content) { ... }`: This line checks if the `content` property exists on the `data` object. If `data.content` is present (and not falsy, like `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `''`, etc.), the code inside the curly braces `{}` will execute. This is a common way to ensure that the data you're trying to process actually exists.

2.  `var node = document.createElement("LI");`: This line creates a new HTML List Item (`<li>`) element and stores it in the variable `node`. The `document.createElement()` function is used to create new elements in the DOM. In this case, it's creating an `<li>` tag, which is typically used for list items in ordered (`<ol>`) or unordered (`<ul>`) lists.

3.  `node.classList.add('event-item');`: This adds a CSS class named `event-item` to the newly created list item (`node`). This is likely for styling purposes, allowing the list item to be styled according to the rules defined for the `event-item` class in the associated CSS.

4.  `var contentNode = document.createTextNode(data.content);`: Here, a new text node is created with the content from `data.content`. `document.createTextNode()` creates a new text node from the given string. This is a safe way to insert text into the DOM because it avoids the risks associated with innerHTML (which can lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities if not used carefully).

5.  `var contentSpan = document.createElement("SPAN");`: A new `<span>` element is created and stored in the variable `contentSpan`. The `<span>` element is an inline container typically used to style a part of a text, or for other inline-level semantics.

6.  `contentSpan.appendChild(contentNode);`: Finally, the text node created earlier (`contentNode`) is appended to the `<span>` element (`contentSpan`). This effectively places the text inside the `<span>` element.

```
var timestampNode = document.createTextNode(new Date(data.created_at * 1000).toLocaleString());
var timestampSpan = document.createElement("SPAN");
timestampSpan.appendChild(timestampNode);
timestampSpan.classList.add('timestamp');
```

1.  `var timestampNode = document.createTextNode(new Date(data.created_at * 1000).toLocaleString());`: This line of code performs several operations:

    -   `data.created_at * 1000`: It's common for timestamps in JavaScript to be in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). If `data.created_at` is a Unix timestamp, it's in seconds, so this code multiplies it by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds.
    -   `new Date(...)`: This creates a new `Date` object with the timestamp provided.
    -   `.toLocaleString()`: This converts the `Date` object to a localized string representing the date and time. The format of this string will depend on the user's locale, meaning it will automatically adjust to the date and time format preferred in the user's region.
    -   `document.createTextNode(...)`: A text node is created with this localized date-time string.

2.  `var timestampSpan = document.createElement("SPAN");`: A new `<span>` element is created and assigned to the variable `timestampSpan`. As before, `<span>` is an inline element commonly used in HTML for grouping and applying styles to inline elements.

3.  `timestampSpan.appendChild(timestampNode);`: The text node created in the first step (which contains the formatted date-time string) is appended to the `span` element. This effectively places the text inside the `<span>`.

4.  `timestampSpan.classList.add('timestamp');`: This adds a CSS class named `timestamp` to the `timestampSpan` element. This is likely for styling purposes, allowing the timestamp to be styled according to the rules defined for the `timestamp` class in the associated CSS.

```
node.appendChild(contentSpan);
node.appendChild(document.createElement("BR"));
node.appendChild(timestampSpan);

document.getElementById("eventsList").appendChild(node);
```

This code assembles a list item with content and timestamp information and inserts it into a specified element on the web page (identified by eventsList). This is a common way to dynamically update a web page with new data received from a server, such as in chat applications, news feeds, or live event logs.

1.  `node.appendChild(contentSpan);`: This line appends the `contentSpan` (which contains the content text inside a `<span>` element) to the `node` (which is an `<li>` element, as created in previous steps). The `appendChild()` method adds a node as the last child of a parent node. In this case, it's adding the content span to the list item.

2.  `node.appendChild(document.createElement("BR"));`: Here, a new `<br>` (line break) element is created and immediately appended to the `node` (the list item). This effectively inserts a line break in the list item, which will cause any subsequent content to appear on a new line.

3.  `node.appendChild(timestampSpan);`: This appends the `timestampSpan` (which contains the formatted timestamp in a `<span>` element) to the `node`. The timestamp will be displayed in the list item below the content, thanks to the line break added in the previous step.

4.  `document.getElementById("eventsList").appendChild(node);`: Finally, this line selects an element from the HTML document with the ID `eventsList` and appends the `node` (the list item with the content and timestamp) to it. The `getElementById()` method is a standard way to select elements in the DOM by their ID. Assuming `eventsList` is the ID of an existing element (probably a `<ul>` or `<ol>`), this line adds the newly created list item as the last child of that element.

```
window.onload = setupWebSocket;
```

The line `window.onload = setupWebSocket;` is a JavaScript statement that assigns the function `setupWebSocket` as the event handler for the window's `load` event. This means that the `setupWebSocket` function will be executed as soon as the window (typically, the web page) has finished loading. Let's break it down:

1.  `window`: In the context of a web browser, `window` is a global object that represents the window containing the DOM document. It's the top-level object in the browser environment, and it contains numerous properties and methods to control the browser window.
2.  `.onload`: This property of the `window` object is an event handler that is triggered when the window has completed loading. This includes the loading of all scripts, images, CSS, and other resources.
3.  `= setupWebSocket`: This assigns the `setupWebSocket` function to the `onload` event handler. Note that the function is referenced by its name without parentheses. This means that you're passing the function itself as a value, not calling the function. The function will only be called when the `load` event occurs.
4.  `;`: This terminates the statement.

In the context of your previous snippets, it seems that `setupWebSocket` is a function that establishes a WebSocket connection and sets up the necessary event handlers for receiving messages from the WebSocket server. By assigning this function to `window.onload`, you ensure that the WebSocket connection is not attempted until the entire page, including all dependent resources, is fully loaded. This is a common practice to make sure that all HTML elements and scripts are available and properly initialized before any interaction or data exchange with a server begins.
