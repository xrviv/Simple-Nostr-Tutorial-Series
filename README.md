# Simple Nostr Tutorial Series

- **Who:** For beginner programmers who want to learn how to build on Nostr
- **What:** A course with the assumption that the user has the least amount of knowledge.
  - Minimum knowledge requirements:
    - HTML, javascript, linux, node.js
    - At least what Nostr is all about.
- **Why:** I want to learn as well.
- **How:** The course will be 100% sourced through prompts from ChatGPT4. Assume that I am copying almost verbatim from ChatGPT. I will be testing this as I go along
- **Problems:** Pull requests, issues, suggestions and corrections welcome.

**Disclaimer:** I am learning about Nostr myself and absolutely do not consider myself an expert on the matter. This is experimental. 
I could not vouch for the security or feasibility of any of the code. In short, by following this, you are taking responsibility for your own risks.
